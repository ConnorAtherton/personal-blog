<div class="entry-content"><p><strong>I&rsquo;M GOING TO THE WORLD CUP!!</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been nearly a year in the planning but we&rsquo;ve finally got everything in place for our trip to Rio next summer. We&rsquo;ve booked flights and an apartment overlooking the beautiful Copacabana and right now we&rsquo;re just playing a waiting game until next summer.</p>

<p>When I say we, I&rsquo;m talking about two of friends from my Computer Science course at uni. The funny thing is that we weren&rsquo;t always friends, in fact I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m stretching to say that we probably didn&rsquo;t even know each other existed the first year. I know, it does seem a little crazy us all going on this trip together but let me explain how we all met first.</p>

<p>During first year at university I felt like <code>that math guy</code>. I&rsquo;d always been that guy since I was a little kid. Everybody else gave me that tag and so I guess I just always thought I would study a math degree and enjoy it. Not so. I just didn&rsquo;t seem enjoy maths except from maybe Matrix Algebra, that was cool, but apart from that it just didn&rsquo;t interest me anymore. It wasn&rsquo;t that it didn&rsquo;t challenge me because it did, I just knew I wanted to build stuff!</p>

<p>So in my second year I took more CS classes alongside some pure math modules (I <strong>despise</strong> statistics) and this turned out to be a great decision for a number of reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>I started to actually build stuff</li>
<li>I enjoyed it a lot more</li>
<li>I was surrounded by people who also wanted to build stuff</li>
<li>I met Matt and Sam, the two guys I&rsquo;m going to Brazil with</li>
</ul>


<p>So I think it was around November 2012 when the idea of going to Brazil started swirling around the computer labs. At the start of the year I was put in a group with Matt to build an Android application and Sam was already good friends with Matt so that&rsquo;s how we all met. The previous month I&rsquo;d just been offered a contract for the academic year to work at the university so I knew that if I saved up enough money from that job I could probably afford it.</p>

<p>Anyway, we kept discussing the idea for a few weeks and eventually we all agreed we were going to do it. It turned out to be a pretty easy decision for all three of us, we bonded over the idea and it does help that all three of us love football. So there we were, 19 months from the start of the World cup and we had made up our minds, whatever it took we were getting there.</p>

<p>It still hadn&rsquo;t sunk in. I&rsquo;ve loved football for as long as I can remember so traveling to Brazil, the home of football, for a World Cup at 20 years of age is an absolute dream.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of those things where a lot of people if they were asked would say they would love to go but there&rsquo;s always a reason not too. One of the biggest being that it&rsquo;s just too expensive and I agree, it is pretty expensive. So far we&rsquo;ve spent around £3000 and that doesn&rsquo;t include spending money etc. So how did three university students come up with that kind of money?</p>

<p>Well we all decided to find summer jobs as soon as possible. I didn&rsquo;t go home over summer, I stayed to work at the university giving staff online software support. Matt worked a job in a factory and I can&rsquo;t  remember exactly off the top of my head what Sam did but he did work, I know that.</p>

<p>Then I found another job as a network assistant helping the university networking team and on top of that I found some client work building a custom Wordpress site. Fair to say we were all pretty busy during Summer 2013.</p>

<p>It was all worth it though. By the time term started again in October we already had flights and a place to stay, we just needed tickets to some of the games and for that each of us had £1300 saved. During the first phase of FIFA releasing the tickets we managed to buy three group game tickets.</p>

<p>Mission Accomplished, we&rsquo;re going to watch some football from inside the stadiums at the World Cup, not many people can say that.</p>

<p>I guess what I&rsquo;ve been trying to write about in this post is the story of how three strangers came together, bonded over a shared dream and worked damn hard to make that dream become reality. Proof that stories like this don&rsquo;t just happen in films.</p>
