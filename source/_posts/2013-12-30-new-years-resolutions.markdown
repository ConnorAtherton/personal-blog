I've noticed a few of these kind of posts surfacing around the internet today so I thought it would be a good idea
to set myself a few goals for 2014.

If nothing else, I have something written down that I can look back on and at least have some sort of baseline of how
good the year is going. 2014 is an incredibly important year for me. I'm going for a once in a lifetime trip to Brazil
for the World Cup, something that has been over a year in planning already. I graduate in July and then it's into the 'real world'
as people keep telling me. I suppose it makes sense, being a student living away from home comes with its own independance but I
feel like I'm still wrapped in a bubble. I want to escape, I know I need to go and work for a real company solving real problems.

Finally I turn 21 at the end of August, another reminder that I have to start making important decisions about my future. The whole idea of
what to do next idea has been on my mind for quite some time now and I think I have an answer. I now know I want, eventually, to start my own company.

Before that though my heart is set on working for a startup. I've had contact with some startups based in London over the past few months
enquiring if I would be interested in working for them. I suspect this is because I have a profile on AngelList. Anyway, here's a message to you
future Connor.

Okay, next one. I've been using Sublime Text 2 for a while now and while it is incredible I think it's time for me to try something else.
Spice it up a bit. Don't get me wrong sublime is incredible, I have no complaints whatsoever. However, my typing technique is atrocious
and knowing that I'll be typing lots over the next few years means I need to learn to touch type. My plan is to slowly switch to vim during
January and at the start of February use vim exclusively for the next few months.

It will be a tough transition but a one I know will benefit me greatly for the rest of my life as a developer.

This one is very simple, be happy. I'm generally a calm person and find good ways of avoiding stress. That's not to say I don't find myself
in stressful situations, I've just learned over the years to relax more and enjoy the challenge. That coupled with working extremely
hard goes quite far. One habit that's kept me happy this year is working out and staying in shape. My whole day is lot more productive if I
get to the gym in the morning. It's also good when you've been programming too long. I can go hours engrossed in code and not drink, eat or even stand up,
so staying active is pretty critical in my life.

> Stay happy. Work hard and enjoy the journey. Get in the best shape of your life for Brazil.

Maybe most important of all.

> Never stop learning...
