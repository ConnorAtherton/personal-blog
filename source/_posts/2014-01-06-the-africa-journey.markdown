Around Easter time in 2011 (I forget exactly when) I travelled to South Africa to represent
Great Britain in the [SABU](http://www.sabisley.com/). As a team we were shooting against the South African
juniors but each members also competed in all the individual competitions too.

We won our team match and overall the team shot really well in extremely hot and windy conditions. Well, the natives
thought it was rather mild but I'm from Northern England so I was actually close to baking in my clothes every single day.

Personally I was pretty happy with how I performed and
if your interested in my competition scores you can see them all [here](http://www.ccrs.org.uk/_webedit/uploaded-files/All%20Files/GB%20U19/GBU19%20Full%20Scores%202011.pdf).

So the real reason I'm writing this right now is because I took lots and lots of pictures but they've been sitting on my computer or on memory cards for too long now.
I was speaking to one of my friends yesterday and I told her I'd hugged some baby lions and played with tigers and other cool stuuf and she really wanted to see the pictures.
On that note, **if any guy out there wants to make a girl giddy show her pictures of baby lions**. Your welcome.

Quick disclaimer before I start, I didn't personally take every single picture here. [View the gallery on flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/113654463@N04/).

Here's a picture of a lion to guilt you into viewing the gallery.
